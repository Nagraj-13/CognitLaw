## **System Architecture** üõ†Ô∏è  

![System Architecture](./images/model.png)  

### **Key Components**:  

1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Extract text from PDF files stored in the `dataset` folder.  
   - Preprocess the text into manageable chunks.  
   - Create embeddings using **FAISS** for fast and accurate retrieval.  

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:  
   - Combines vector-based search (**FAISS**) with generative models.  
   - Finds relevant documents and uses **Google Generative AI** to craft answers.  

3. **Conversational Interface**:  
   - Built with **Streamlit** for a seamless, interactive user experience.  
   - Users input queries, and LawBot delivers accurate, context-aware responses.  

4. **Enhancements**:  
   - **Gemini API**: Augments document analysis for deeper insights.

## **How It Works** üîç  

### **1. Data Ingestion**  
- Extract and preprocess text from legal PDFs stored in the `dataset` directory.  
- Create a FAISS-based vector store to index legal content efficiently.  

### **2. Question Answering**  
- Users ask legal questions through the interface.  
- LawBot uses FAISS to retrieve the most relevant document chunks.  
- Answers are generated using **RAG** methods, combining search results with generative AI for accuracy.
